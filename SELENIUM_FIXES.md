# Selenium WebDriver Fixes

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve `SessionNotCreatedException` and browser closure issues in your NCAA scraper.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. SessionNotCreatedException
- **Cause**: Version mismatches between Chrome and ChromeDriver
- **Solution**: Implemented WebDriverManager for automatic version management

### 2. Browser/Driver Closure Issues
- **Cause**: Improper driver cleanup and session management
- **Solution**: Added robust cleanup mechanisms and safe driver quitting

### 3. Docker Environment Issues
- **Cause**: Missing dependencies and improper Chrome setup
- **Solution**: Enhanced Dockerfile with proper Chrome installation and permissions

## Changes Made

### 1. Requirements.txt
- Added `webdriver-manager>=4.0.0` for automatic ChromeDriver version management
- This ensures compatibility between Chrome browser and ChromeDriver versions

### 2. Enhanced SeleniumUtils (selenium_utils.py)

#### New Features:
- **Retry Mechanism**: Driver creation now retries up to 3 times on failure
- **Automatic Version Management**: Uses WebDriverManager to handle Chrome/ChromeDriver compatibility
- **Robust Error Handling**: Catches and handles `SessionNotCreatedException` specifically
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatically cleans up failed driver instances
- **Safe Driver Quitting**: Properly closes all windows before quitting driver

#### Key Improvements:
```python
# Retry logic with cleanup
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        # Create driver with enhanced options
        # Test driver functionality
        return driver
    except SessionNotCreatedException:
        # Clean up and retry
        SeleniumUtils._cleanup_driver_resources()
        time.sleep(2)
```

#### Enhanced Chrome Options:
- Added more stability flags for Docker environment
- Disabled automation detection features
- Improved headless mode configuration
- Added proper binary location detection

### 3. Updated NCAA Scraper (ncaa_scraper.py)
- Uses new retry mechanism: `SeleniumUtils.create_driver(headless=True, max_retries=3)`
- Implements safe driver cleanup: `SeleniumUtils.safe_quit_driver(self.driver)`

### 4. Enhanced Dockerfile
- Added `procps` and `psmisc` for process management
- Set proper environment variables for WebDriverManager
- Created necessary directories with correct permissions
- Added `DOCKER_CONTAINER=true` flag for automatic headless mode

## How the Fixes Work

### Version Compatibility
1. WebDriverManager automatically downloads the correct ChromeDriver version
2. Falls back to ChromeType.CHROMIUM if regular Chrome fails (Docker environments)
3. Caches drivers to avoid repeated downloads

### Error Recovery
1. If driver creation fails, cleanup any partial instances
2. Wait 2 seconds before retry
3. Attempt up to 3 times before giving up
4. Log detailed error information for debugging

### Resource Management
1. Properly close all browser windows before quitting
2. Kill any orphaned Chrome/ChromeDriver processes
3. Clean up temporary directories
4. Handle both Windows and Unix-like systems

## Usage

The fixes are automatically applied when you run the scraper. No code changes needed in your main application.

### For Docker:
```bash
docker build -t ncaa-scraper .
docker run ncaa-scraper
```

### For Local Development:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Chrome Version**: Ensure Chrome is installed and accessible
2. **Clear Cache**: Delete `/tmp/chrome-session` or `chrome-session` directories
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure Chrome binary has execute permissions
4. **Review Logs**: Check the detailed logging output for specific error messages

### Common Solutions:
- **macOS**: Allow Chrome in System Settings > Privacy & Security
- **Linux**: Ensure Chrome binary is executable (`chmod +x /usr/bin/google-chrome`)
- **Docker**: The enhanced Dockerfile should handle most permission issues

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Version Management**: No more manual ChromeDriver updates
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from temporary failures
3. **Better Resource Management**: Prevents memory leaks and orphaned processes
4. **Docker Optimized**: Works reliably in containerized environments
5. **Cross-Platform**: Handles Windows, macOS, and Linux differences

The scraper should now be much more reliable and handle the common Selenium WebDriver issues you were experiencing.
